# Single Cycle Mips Processor Design
The project aims to design a Single Cycle 32-Bit MIPS Micro-Processor (RISC-Like Harvard Architecture), Using Verilog HDL. the processor is simulated on ModelSim tool. To test the design the processor is simulated on ModelSim tool.
I ran the following programs:

-Get GCD between 120 and 180.

-Get the factorial of 7.
 
-Get the Fibonacci sequence
